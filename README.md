## Assessment Criteria
### Front End
The first part of the project assessment will evaluate the front-end functionality of the application:

<ol>
  <li> The application must be functional so that the user can easily use the application as intended. </li>
  <li> The application must be implemented using HTML, CSS and Javascript (or a subset thereof). </li>
  <li> All resources used (including pictures, JavaScript libraries, css) must be fully referenced. </li>
  <li> The HTML and CSS must pass the validators: <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" > https://validator.w3.org/ </a> and <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" > https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ </a> . </li>

  <li> There must be a consistent style (via CSS file) for all pages, yet each page should be easily identifiable. </li>
</ol>

### Back-end (40%)

The second part of the project assessment evaluates the back-end functionality of the application. At least the following functionality should be provided:
